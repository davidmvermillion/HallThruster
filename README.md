# Background

While [Hall Effect Thrusters](https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LEW-TOPS-34) are very fuel efficient, their thrust power is on the order of a mouse fart. üêÅüí®

This dichotomy made me curious about who does the most research and development and where that experimentation takes place. ü§î

So naturally, I went to data.gov to find some data! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The data came primarily from the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate.

I created a [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidmvermillion_vdsml-space-spacewithdavid-activity-6951559448729440257-qbBS?) presenting my findings in video form with plenty of discussion! If you want to embed the video presentation, I recommend using the [YouTube version](https://youtu.be/lZw_Q-ir70M).

# Files

- [data_exploration.R](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/HallThruster/blob/main/data_exploration.R) is the primary script file for the analysis.
- [Who Studies Hall Effect Thrusters and Where.pdf](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/HallThruster/blob/main/Who%20Studies%20Hall%20Effect%20Thrusters%20and%20Where.pdf) is the PDF version of my analysis.
- [Who Studies Hall Effect Thrusters and Where.pptx](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/HallThruster/blob/main/Who%20Studies%20Hall%20Effect%20Thrusters%20and%20Where.pptx) is the PowerPoint version of my analysis.
- [data](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/HallThruster/tree/main/data) is the folder with the JSON files I analyzed.

# Additional Presentations

Besides my primary summary presentation, this project served as a springboard for additional video and text content. I‚Äôll update this section with each new product.
