Cathode lifetime in the harsh environment of an ion thruster has been a major issue with cold cathode sources.  The anticipated long life with the proposed technology is due to the combination of three design features.  The first feature is the choice of an edge emitter geometry known to be much more robust compared to other geometries such as tip emitters or nanotube configurations.  The second feature is the choice of carbon as the emitter material.  Carbon is well known for resistance to damage from ion bombardment.  The third feature is the deposition of the carbon edge emitter inside one end of a channel plate.  The channel plate provides some shielding from the thruster ion stream.   A further benefit could be realized by using a standard electron multiplying channel plate so as to also greatly increase the electron density of the source.","startYear":2004,"startMonth":1,"endYear":2004,"endMonth":7,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":411361,"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Hellmer","fullName":"Ronald Hellmer","fullNameInverted":"Hellmer, Ronald","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
