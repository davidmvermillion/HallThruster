At the end of the project, we will have a complete brassboard PPU except for the Digital Control and Interface Unit (DCIU) and Flow Control Driver.  The brassboard PPU meets the electrical requirements of the project, but the specific mass is about 20% too low compared to the first bullet of the solicitation.  Preliminary results from testing a 4 kW discharge supply show that the full-power efficiency ranges from 94% to 96%.  This proposal is to: (1)\tDetermine ways to reduce the mass of the brassboard PPU (2)\tEvaluate the brassboard PPU to determine robustness improvements to be implemented in Phase II. (3)\tDetermine requirements for a DCIU to be implemented in Phase II. (4)\tDesign and build a brassboard Flow Control Driver (5)\tGain experience in controlling  gas flow The Flow Control Driver will be designed to control a xenon gas flow system selected by NASA.  The DCIU design will be based on requirements received from NASA.   The significance of this project is that it makes improvements to an innovative and promising PPU technology, moving it closer to a flight-ready product, while also facilitating NASA research with advanced flow controls.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2010,"startMonth":1,"endYear":2010,"endMonth":7,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":57597,"firstName":"Bryce","lastName":"Hesterman","fullName":"Bryce L Hesterman","fullNameInverted":"Hesterman, Bryce L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"bryce.hesterman@c-pwr.com","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":57596,"firstName":"Bryce","lastName":"Hesterman","fullName":"Bryce Hesterman","fullNameInverted":"Hesterman, Bryce","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[{"caption":"Low-Cost High-Performance Hall Thruster Support System, Phase I Project Image","file":{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":133008,"fileName":"SBIR_16_1_S3.04-8077","fileSize":1188354,"objectId":158595,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"1.2 MB"},"files":[{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":133008,"fileName":"SBIR_16_1_S3.04-8077","fileSize":1188354,"objectId":158595,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"1.2 MB"}],"id":158595,"title":"Final Summary Chart Image","description":"Low-Cost High-Performance Hall Thruster Support System, Phase I Project Image","libraryItemTypeId":1095,"projectId":8622,"primary":false,"publishedDateString":"","contentType":{"lkuCodeId":1095,"code":"IMAGE","description":"Image","lkuCodeTypeId":341,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"LIBRARY_ITEM_TYPE","description":"Library Item Type"}}}],"transitions":[{"transitionId":16315,"projectId":8622,"transitionDate":"2010-07-01","path":"Closed Out","closeoutDocuments":[{"title":"Final Summary Chart","file":{"fileExtension":"pdf","fileId":140029,"fileName":"SBIR_2009_1_FSC_S3.04-8077","fileSize":170968,"objectId":16315,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":1841,"code":"TRANSITION_FILES","description":"Transition Files","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"fileSizeString":"171.0 KB"},"transitionId":16315,"fileId":140029}],"infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"July 2010"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
