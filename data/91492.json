Iodine can be launched as an inert solid and then vaporized into an ionized gas once in orbit, which removes the risk to the launch vehicle and primary payload. Launching as a dense solid instead of a gas also increases the amount propellant that can be stored in the same volume on the spacecraft. An iodine thruster like the one worked on under iSat would allow a small spacecraft to alter its orbital inclination and elevation, opening up a wider range of mission objectives than previously possible with spacecraft of this size.</p>","description":"<p>The Iodine Satellite (iSat) spacecraft was a to be the first CubeSat to demonstrate high change in velocity from a secondary payload launch safe propulsion system using a Hall thruster modified to use iodine as a propellant.

The program seeks to develop subsystem technologies that are new and revolutionary in their impact, rather than incremental improvements of existing subsystems. The goal is to advance subsystem technologies from a readiness level of 3 (analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept) to a readiness level of 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment).   Support flight demonstrations of new technologies, capabilities and applications for small spacecraft. The program seeks to demonstrate technologies that are new and capabilities that have not previously been demonstrated in space. The goal is to advance technologies and capabilities from a readiness level of 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment) to a readiness level of at least 7 (system prototype demonstration in an operational environment).   Use small spacecraft as platforms for testing and demonstrating technologies and capabilities that might have more general applications in larger-scale spacecraft and systems. The program seeks to contribute to the full range of NASA's science and technology challenges, where demonstrations with small spacecraft can reduce the cost, risk, complexity or time required to advance the state-of-the-art.","programId":65,"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"responsibleMdId":4875,"stockImageFileId":36659,"title":"Small Spacecraft Technology"},"leadOrganization":{"acronym":"MSFC","canUserEdit":false,"city":"Huntsville","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4854,"organizationName":"Marshall Space Flight Center","organizationType":"NASA_Center","stateTerritory":{"abbreviation":"AL","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Alabama","stateTerritoryId":18},"stateTerritoryId":18,"naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Center"},"supportingOrganizations":[{"acronym":"USAF","canUserEdit":false,"city":"Washington","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"external":true,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4878,"organizationName":"Air Force","organizationType":"US_Government","stateTerritory":{"abbreviation":"DC","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"District of Columbia","stateTerritoryId":26},"stateTerritoryId":26,"naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"US Government"},{"canUserEdit":false,"city":"Natick","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"external":true,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":2726,"organizationName":"Busek Company, Inc.","organizationType":"Industry","stateTerritory":{"abbreviation":"MA","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Massachusetts","stateTerritoryId":30},"stateTerritoryId":30,"msiData":{},"setAsideData":["Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB)"],"ein":"273052791 ","dunsNumber":"184629491","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"Industry"},{"acronym":"GRC","canUserEdit":false,"city":"Cleveland","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4860,"organizationName":"Glenn Research Center","organizationType":"NASA_Center","stateTerritory":{"abbreviation":"OH","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Ohio","stateTerritoryId":23},"stateTerritoryId":23,"naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Center"}],"statesWithWork":[{"abbreviation":"AL","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Alabama","stateTerritoryId":18},{"abbreviation":"DC","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"District of Columbia","stateTerritoryId":26},{"abbreviation":"MA","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Massachusetts","stateTerritoryId":30},{"abbreviation":"OH","country":{"abbreviation":"US","countryId":236,"name":"United States"},"countryId":236,"name":"Ohio","stateTerritoryId":23}],"lastUpdated":"2022-3-22","releaseStatusString":"Released","endDateString":"Sep 2017","startDateString":"Jul 2014"}}
