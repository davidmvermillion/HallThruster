Single die ratings of > 1200 V, > 75 A, > 225Â°C and compliance to a NASA-certified radiation hardness assurance program are targeted for the proposed SiC power devices. The target application for these devices involves a 30 kW power processor unit (PPU) on-board a Hall Thruster Propulsion System operating at a 300-400 V (average) DC bias with a peak voltage of 600 V.  Several innovative device designs and process steps for fabricating RHBD SiC power DMOSFETs and Schottky rectifiers will be developed during Phase I. Building on the device development conducted during Phase I, the design and fabrication of traveled guided 1200 V/75 A SiC DMOSFET and Schottky rectifier wafer lots will be conducted during the Phase II program. The existing packaging techniques will be modified for meeting the required radiation standards from NASA. Selected die from both phases of the proposed program will be packaged in appropriate headers for controlled dose radiation testing as per NASA requirements. A rigorous space-level (JANS) qualification will be conducted on the fabricated devices during Phase II. Phase II will culminate with the insertion of the SiC power DMOSFETs and Schottky rectifiers into a 30 kW power processing unit (PPU) relevant to a NASA electric propulsion system and demonstrating stable operation.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination
