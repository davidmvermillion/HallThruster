As launch costs can be up to a third of total mission costs, stepping down to a smaller rocket can be a mission enabling technology in today's budget constrained environment.   While missions such as Dawn have used this to visit multiple asteroids after launch from a small launch vehicle, ExoTerra's SolRider Direct Drive (DD) SEP module allows interplanetary missions to take the next step down in launch cost to package within standard rideshare envelope and mass contraints.  Our module integrates multiple technologies to provide up to 8.6 km/s within an Atlas Aft Bulkhead Carrier rideshare or 14.6 km/s of delta-V within a standard ESPA.  This can enable launch costs below $5M. Our integrated DD SEP module uses a combination of SEP technologies to create a highly efficient system to package within the rideshare envelope. We use a 175 W/kg and 60kW/m3 rolled composite tube solar array deployment system to package within the tight volume.  This provides 300 V power to the thruster through a direct drive system, eliminating the cost, mass and electrical losses of the traditional power processing unit. A Hall Thruster uses the high voltage power to efficiently propel the craft with over 1600 s of Isp.  The thruster receives the propellant from a cryogenic Xenon feed system, allowing an order of magnitude drop in tank mass.  When coupled to Microsatellite electronics, the system can deliver up to 5.5 kg of payload instruments to Mars orbit.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2013,"startMonth":5,"endYear":2013,"endMonth":11,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":370811,"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Wilbur","fullName":"Paul Wilbur","fullNameInverted":"Wilbur, Paul","primaryEmail":"pwilbur@engr.colostate.edu","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[{"caption":"Microsatellite Direct Drive SEP Module for Interplanetary Exploration via Rideshare","file":{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":134444,"fileName":"SBIR_2012_1_BC_S3.03-9304","fileSize":243734,"objectId":160116,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"243.7 KB"},"files":[{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":134444,"fileName":"SBIR_2012_1_BC_S3.03-9304","fileSize":243734,"objectId":160116,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"243.7 KB"}],"id":160116,"title":"Project Image","description":"Microsatellite Direct Drive SEP Module for Interplanetary Exploration via Rideshare","libraryItemTypeId":1095,"projectId":16785,"primary":true,"publishedDateString":"","contentType":{"lkuCodeId":1095,"code":"IMAGE","description":"Image","lkuCodeTypeId":341,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"LIBRARY_ITEM_TYPE","description":"Library Item Type"}}}],"transitions":[{"transitionId":14567,"projectId":16785,"transitionDate":"2013-11-01","infusion":"Other","path":"Closed Out","details":"","closeoutDocuments":[{"title":"Final Summary Chart","file":{"fileExtension":"pdf","fileId":138303,"fileName":"SBIR_2012_1_FSC_S3.03-9304","fileSize":219138,"objectId":14567,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":1841,"code":"TRANSITION_FILES","description":"Transition Files","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"fileSizeString":"219.1 KB"},"transitionId":14567,"fileId":138303}],"infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"November 2013"}],"primaryImage":{"file":{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":134444,"fileSizeString":"0 Byte"},"id":160116,"description":"Microsatellite Direct Drive SEP Module for Interplanetary Exploration via Rideshare","projectId":16785,"publishedDateString":""},"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
