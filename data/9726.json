Modern Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) are a proven technology with flight heritage, established manufacturing readiness and testing channels that nearly meet the desired specifications (as shown in Figure 1).  However, the major limitation is that HETs fail to achieve all four of objectives simultaneously. This Phase I feasibility study is focused on a proof-of-concept experiment to alleviate the HET dual-mode operational envelope limitation for both high thrust-to-power and high specific impulse.   Starfire Industries believes that a \"low hanging fruit\" modification to HETs exists, and such an improvement would be evolutionary to enable multi-mission EP systems for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and DoD platforms.  Towards this end, Starfire has partnered with Aerojet Corporation to rapidly demonstrate feasibility in Phase I through experimental modification to an existing HET system.  If results are confirmed, a Phase II design can be driven to yield immediate upgrades for flight-qualified HET systems for near-term payback.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2011,"startMonth":2,"endYear":2011,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":52320,"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Jurczyk","fullName":"Brian E Jurczyk","fullNameInverted":"Jurczyk, Brian E","middleInitial":"E","primaryEmail":"bjurczyk@starfireindustries.com","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[],"transitions":[{"transitionId":14453,"projectId":9726,"transitionDate":"2011-09-01","infusion":"Other","path":"Closed Out","details":"","closeoutDocuments":[{"title":"Final Summary Chart","file":{"fileExtension":"pdf","fileId":138189,"fileName":"SBIR_2010_1_FSC_S3.04-8822","fileSize":64953,"objectId":14453,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":1841,"code":"TRANSITION_FILES","description":"Transition Files","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"fileSizeString":"65.0 KB"},"transitionId":14453,"fileId":138189}],"infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"September 2011"}],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
