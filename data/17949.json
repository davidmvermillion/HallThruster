In this respect, the annular engine, whose design inherently allows for significant increases in perveance by resolving the span-to-gap problem, can achieve the projected high current densities necessary for high thrust, high power applications. The case for high power gridded ion thrusters is compelling if not only for risk reduction in contrast to lower TRL Hall thruster variants such as the nested channel systems. This point cannot be over emphasized as there is now significant effort and resources applied to Hall engine development.  Yet there still remains some uncertainty as to how high power variants or magnetically insulated variants will actually perform in space. Interpretation of high power Hall engine operation in ground test facilities is also not completely well understood.  This is in contrast with gridded ion technology whose facility corrections are well understood.  The current investment in high power gridded ion thruster technology is minimal.  This effort seeks to address this gap in technology development and in the process continue the advancement of a credible risk reducing technology for high power mission applications.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2014,"startMonth":6,"endYear":2014,"endMonth":12,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":78465,"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Davis","fullName":"Christopher Davis","fullNameInverted":"Davis, Christopher","primaryEmail":"davis@edapplications.com","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[{"caption":"Divergent Field Annular Ion Engine Project Image","file":{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":130929,"fileName":"SBIR_2014_1_BC_H2.01-8814","fileSize":467793,"objectId":156403,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"467.8 KB"},"files":[{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":130929,"fileName":"SBIR_2014_1_BC_H2.01-8814","fileSize":467793,"objectId":156403,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"467.8 KB"}],"id":156403,"title":"Project Image","description":"Divergent Field Annular Ion Engine Project Image","libraryItemTypeId":1095,"projectId":17949,"primary":true,"publishedDateString":"","contentType":{"lkuCodeId":1095,"code":"IMAGE","description":"Image","lkuCodeTypeId":341,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"LIBRARY_ITEM_TYPE","description":"Library Item Type"}}}],"transitions":[{"transitionId":13822,"projectId":17949,"transitionDate":"2014-12-01","infusion":"Other","path":"Closed Out","details":"","closeoutDocuments":[{"title":"Final Summary Chart","file":{"fileExtension":"pdf","fileId":137564,"fileName":"SBIR_2014_1_FSC_H2.01-8814","fileSize":45997,"objectId":13822,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":1841,"code":"TRANSITION_FILES","description":"Transition Files","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"fileSizeString":"46.0 KB"},"transitionId":13822,"fileId":137564}],"infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"December 2014"}],"primaryImage":{"file":{"fileExtension":"png","fileId":130929,"fileSizeString":"0 Byte"},"id":156403,"description":"Divergent Field Annular Ion Engine Project Image","projectId":17949,"publishedDateString":""},"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
