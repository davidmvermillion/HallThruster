The advanced magnetic alloy (AMA) is the material of choice for the ferromagnetic parts of an HET&#39;s magnetic circuit. &nbsp;In addition to its superior magnetic properties, the AMA is also thought to be compatible with reactive propellants such as iodine.&nbsp; Currently, traditional machining is employed to fabricate these ferromagnetic parts.&nbsp; This results in removal of nearly 80% of the expensive bulk material which then goes unused.&nbsp; Additionally, traditional machining can cause unwanted deformation on thin parts, reducing the production yield.&nbsp; In Phase I, Busek and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) propose to study the feasibility of 3D printing AMA magnetic circuit components.&nbsp; Our team will consider suitable additive manufacturing (AM) processes, including ebeam/laser AM processes, and a binderjet process with suitable binders.&nbsp; We will evaluate test coupons printed by ORNL by measuring their relevant magnetic properties and comparing them to those made using traditional machining methods.&nbsp; Additionally, we will apply relevant heat treatments to 3D printed test coupons and then re-measure their magnetic properties. The results will be compared to those made using traditional machining methods that were subjected to identical heat treatments.&nbsp; Based on the Phase I results, the best AM process will be down-selected to print a magnetic circuit component for the Busek 200W HET, with the goal of integrating it into the thruster in a potential Phase II program.</p>
