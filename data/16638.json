These direct drive system designs eliminate the power processing unit (PPU) and therefore have a substantial advantage in terms of overall electrical efficiency and mass savings.    This Phase I/II proposal effort is comprised of the development of a Hall thruster direct drive unit (DDU).  The DDU will include a method for cathode current sharing such that multiple thrusters can be operated in parallel from a single power source.  In Phase I cathode current sharing approaches will be experimentally investigated.  Approaches to be evaluated include passive and active methods of cathode current control.  Active approaches involves independently controlled voltage sources placed in series with each cathode while passive approaches involve controlling cathode emission using  heater and keeper power.  In Phase II we will develop a nominal 15kW proto-flight brassboard level DDU and deliver it to NASA for additional characterization testing.  The DDU unit will include the balance of PPU per specifications provided by NASA for thruster magnets, cathode heater and keeper etc. operation.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2013,"startMonth":5,"endYear":2013,"endMonth":11,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":142371,"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Ehrbar","fullName":"Eric Ehrbar","fullNameInverted":"Ehrbar, Eric","primaryEmail":"eric@busek.com","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[{"caption":"Direct Drive Unit with Autonomous Cathode Current Regulation","file":{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":135898,"fileName":"SBIR_S_2012_1_BC_E1.01-9065","fileSize":239519,"objectId":161646,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"239.5 KB"},"files":[{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":135898,"fileName":"SBIR_S_2012_1_BC_E1.01-9065","fileSize":239519,"objectId":161646,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"239.5 KB"}],"id":161646,"title":"Project Image","description":"Direct Drive Unit with Autonomous Cathode Current Regulation","libraryItemTypeId":1095,"projectId":16638,"primary":true,"publishedDateString":"","contentType":{"lkuCodeId":1095,"code":"IMAGE","description":"Image","lkuCodeTypeId":341,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"LIBRARY_ITEM_TYPE","description":"Library Item Type"}}}],"transitions":[{"transitionId":14363,"projectId":16638,"transitionDate":"2013-11-01","infusion":"Other","path":"Closed Out","details":"","closeoutDocuments":[{"title":"Final Summary Chart","file":{"fileExtension":"pdf","fileId":138100,"fileName":"SBIR_S_2012_1_FSC_E1.01-9065","fileSize":201797,"objectId":14363,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":1841,"code":"TRANSITION_FILES","description":"Transition Files","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"fileSizeString":"201.8 KB"},"transitionId":14363,"fileId":138100}],"infoText":"Closed out","infoTextExtra":"","dateText":"November 2013"}],"primaryImage":{"file":{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":135898,"fileSizeString":"0 Byte"},"id":161646,"description":"Direct Drive Unit with Autonomous Cathode Current Regulation","projectId":16638,"publishedDateString":""},"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
