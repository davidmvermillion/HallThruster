To this end, Brian is developing laser sensors based on the ultra-sensitive cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique and is using these sensors to measure sputter products in the plume of the operating thruster. As part of this fellowship Brian will work with Hall thruster researchers at NASA Glenn Research Center with the overarching goal of transferring the diagnostics capability from his university laboratory to NASA.  In comparison to the currently used full life testing approach, the use of the CRDS sensor will have several advantages:  thruster erosion can be measured in situ with high sensitivity readily allowing one to study changes in erosion rate with time and with thruster operating conditions;  the sensor can be used relatively quickly and inexpensively;  the sensor data provides number density and velocity information on the sputtered particles enabling comparisons against numerical models (and model validation).","startYear":2011,"startMonth":8,"endYear":2015,"endMonth":8,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":37085,"firstName":"Azer","lastName":"Yalin","fullName":"Azer Yalin","fullNameInverted":"Yalin, Azer","primaryEmail":"ayalin@engr.colostate.edu","publicEmail":false,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":84634,"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Meyer","fullName":"Claudia M Meyer","fullNameInverted":"Meyer, Claudia M","middleInitial":"M","primaryEmail":"claudia.m.meyer@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":84634,"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Meyer","fullName":"Claudia M Meyer","fullNameInverted":"Meyer, Claudia M","middleInitial":"M","primaryEmail":"claudia.m.meyer@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":183514,"firstName":"Hung","lastName":"Nguyen","fullName":"Hung D Nguyen","fullNameInverted":"Nguyen, Hung D","middleInitial":"D","primaryEmail":"hung.d.nguyen@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":52530,"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Lee","fullName":"Brian S Lee","fullNameInverted":"Lee, Brian S","middleInitial":"S","primaryEmail":"brian.lee@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"website":"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/home/index.html","libraryItems":[{"caption":"Project Image   Hall Thrusters and Erosion (Lifetime) Measurements","file":{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":1769,"fileName":"4269-1363185032487","fileSize":194342,"objectId":461,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"194.3 KB"},"files":[{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":1769,"fileName":"4269-1363185032487","fileSize":194342,"objectId":461,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"194.3 KB"}],"id":461,"title":"4269-1363185032487.jpg","description":"Project Image   Hall Thrusters and Erosion (Lifetime) Measurements","libraryItemTypeId":1095,"projectId":4269,"primary":true,"publishedDateString":"","contentType":{"lkuCodeId":1095,"code":"IMAGE","description":"Image","lkuCodeTypeId":341,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"LIBRARY_ITEM_TYPE","description":"Library Item Type"}}}],"transitions":[],"primaryImage":{"file":{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":1769,"fileSizeString":"0 Byte"},"id":461,"description":"Project Image   Hall Thrusters and Erosion (Lifetime) Measurements","projectId":4269,"publishedDateString":""},"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"STRG","active":true,"description":"<p> \tThe Space Technology Research Grants Program will accelerate the development of &quot;push&quot; technologies to support the future space science and exploration needs of NASA, other government agencies and the commercial space sector.
