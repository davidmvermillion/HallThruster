Inc. tested an existing Hall thruster, the BHT-8000, on iodine propellant.  The thruster was fed by a high flow iodine feed system, and supported by an existing Busek hollow cathode flowing xenon gas.  The Phase I propellant feed system was evolved from a previously demonstrated laboratory feed system.  Throttling of the thruster between 2 and 11 kW at 200-600V was demonstrated.  Testing has shown that the efficiency of iodine fueled BHT-8000 is the same as with xenon, with iodine delivering slightly higher thrust to power (T/P).   Plume current was also measured at a variety of operating conditions.  Preliminary design work for a new thruster to be built in Phase II was also completed.    In Phase II a complete iodine fueled system will be developed including the thruster, hollow cathode, and iodine propellant feed system.  The nominal power of the Phase II system is 8 kW.  However, it can be deeply throttled as well as clustered to much higher power levels.  The technology can also be scaled to >100 kW per thruster to support MW-class missions.  The target thruster efficiency for the full scale system is 65% at high Isp (~3000 s) and 60% at high thrust (Isp~2000 s).  These projections are based on Phase I testing and prior testing of higher power thrusters.    Iodine enables dramatic mass and cost savings for lunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers.  High purity iodine is available commercially in large quantities at much lower cost than xenon.  Iodine stores at 2 to 3 times greater density than xenon and at approximately one thousandth of the pressure and may be stored in low mass, low cost propellant tanks instead.  Passive, long term storage of a fully fueled system is feasible including storage in conformal tanks which may be used to shield internal components against some types of space radiation.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1545,"code":"THE_SUN","description":"The Sun","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1544,"code":"THE_MOON","description":"The Moon","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1547,"code":"OUTSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Outside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2013,"startMonth":7,"endYear":2016,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":200442,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Szabo","fullName":"James Szabo","fullNameInverted":"Szabo, James","primaryEmail":"jszabo@busek.com","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":206378,"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kessler","fullName":"Jason L Kessler","fullNameInverted":"Kessler, Jason L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jason.l.kessler@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":215154,"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Gustetic","fullName":"Jennifer L Gustetic","fullNameInverted":"Gustetic, Jennifer L","middleInitial":"L","primaryEmail":"jennifer.l.gustetic@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":62051,"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Torrez","fullName":"Carlos Torrez","fullNameInverted":"Torrez, Carlos","primaryEmail":"carlos.torrez@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"coInvestigators":[{"contactId":200432,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Szabo","fullName":"James Szabo","fullNameInverted":"Szabo, James","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"libraryItems":[{"caption":"Iodine Hall Thruster for Space Exploration, Phase II","file":{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":135183,"fileName":"SBIR_2011_2_BC_X2.03-8838","fileSize":33204,"objectId":160899,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"33.2 KB"},"files":[{"fileExtension":"jpg","fileId":135183,"fileName":"SBIR_2011_2_BC_X2.03-8838","fileSize":33204,"objectId":160899,"objectType":{"lkuCodeId":889,"code":"LIBRARY_ITEMS","description":"Library Items","lkuCodeTypeId":182,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"OBJECT_TYPE","description":"Object Type"}},"objectTypeId":889,"fileSizeString":"33.2 KB"}],"id":160899,"title":"Briefing Chart","description":"Iodine Hall Thruster for Space Exploration, Phase II","libraryItemTypeId":1095,"projectId":16720,"primary":false,"publishedDateString":"","contentType":{"lkuCodeId":1095,"code":"IMAGE","description":"Image","lkuCodeTypeId":341,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"LIBRARY_ITEM_TYPE","description":"Library Item Type"}}}],"transitions":[],"responsibleMd":{"acronym":"STMD","canUserEdit":false,"city":"","external":false,"linkCount":0,"organizationId":4875,"organizationName":"Space Technology Mission Directorate","organizationType":"NASA_Mission_Directorate","naorganization":false,"organizationTypePretty":"NASA Mission Directorate"},"program":{"acronym":"SBIR/STTR","active":true,"description":"<p>The NASA SBIR and STTR programs fund the research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs as described in the annual Solicitations and have significant potential for successful commercialization.
