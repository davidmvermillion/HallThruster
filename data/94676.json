The scalability of the propellant system design makes it applicable for a wide range of spacecraft sizes and mission architectures.</p>   <p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">A compact, reliable, affordable propellant system for SEP expands the utility of SEP for commercial satellites beyond station keeping.&nbsp; Exoterra&rsquo;s Xenon Micro Electric Propulsion System can be used for&nbsp; orbit raising and maintenance for commercial microsatellites.&nbsp; The system can also be used in an SEP-based upper stage for the burgeoning small launch vehicle market, delivering microsatellites from LEO to GEO orbit or beyond.</p> ","description":"<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">While CubeSats have begun to disrupt the entire satellite industry, a lack of adequate propulsion options continues to limit their adoption beyond experimental missions.&nbsp; Rideshare restrictions limit CubeSats to the non-optimal orbits into which the primary mission delivers them, and often leaves them unable to maintain their orbits against drag from Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere.&nbsp; This restricts CubeSat utility for commercial, persistent Earth science, or interplanetary missions.&nbsp; ExoTerra&rsquo;s Modular Xenon Micro Electric Propulsion System is a high-impulse propulsion system that enables CubeSats to alter or maintain their orbits and to perform affordable, targeted science missions throughout the inner solar system.&nbsp; The integrated system provides 4-33 mN of thrust and 48-73 kNs of impulse at an I<sub>sp</sub> from 700-1500 s using a micro-Hall Effect Thruster, and can package in 6 or 9 U of volume to meet the tight constraints of CubeSats.&nbsp; The propulsion system consists of the Xenon propellant and distribution system, a high efficiency PPU that is radiation tolerant to 100krad, the Halo thruster and TVC.&nbsp; &nbsp;The system achieves &gt;.15 mN/Usc, &gt;5 kNs/Up and &lt;1.3 kg/Up.</p>
