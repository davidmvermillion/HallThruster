The new propulsion system will take advantage of the ~2.4X improved propellant density to extend mission operations in low earth orbit and enable deep space planetary science missions.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1543,"code":"EARTH","description":"Earth","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination
