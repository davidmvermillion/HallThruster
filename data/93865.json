This will improve the sensitivity (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) of the instrument. The increase of VLWIR detector operating temperatures will reduce the size, weight and power (SWaP) of infrared imagers and spectrometers. This will broaden the application areas of these instruments, in particular for low cost CubeSats/SmallSat for Earth and planetary science missions.","description":"To design and test an auxiliary gas injection technique that reduces discharge oscillations and enables longer lifetimes for Hall Thrusters operating at high Isp.","destinations":[{"lkuCodeId":1546,"code":"INSIDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM","description":"Others Inside the Solar System","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}},{"lkuCodeId":1518,"code":"MARS","description":"Mars","lkuCodeTypeId":526,"lkuCodeType":{"codeType":"DESTINATION_TYPE","description":"Destination Type"}}],"startYear":2017,"startMonth":10,"endYear":2018,"endMonth":9,"statusDescription":"Completed","principalInvestigators":[{"contactId":481342,"firstName":"Vernon","lastName":"Chaplin","fullName":"Vernon H Chaplin","fullNameInverted":"Chaplin, Vernon H","middleInitial":"H","primaryEmail":"vernon.h.chaplin@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programDirectors":[{"contactId":335305,"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lapointe","fullName":"Michael R Lapointe","fullNameInverted":"Lapointe, Michael R","middleInitial":"R","primaryEmail":"michael.r.lapointe@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programExecutives":[{"contactId":392233,"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Howard","fullName":"Richard W Howard","fullNameInverted":"Howard, Richard W","middleInitial":"W","primaryEmail":"richard.w.howard@nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"programManagers":[{"contactId":155484,"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Hadaegh","fullName":"Fred Y Hadaegh","fullNameInverted":"Hadaegh, Fred Y","middleInitial":"Y","primaryEmail":"fred.y.hadaegh@jpl.nasa.gov","publicEmail":true,"nacontact":false}],"website":"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/innovation_fund/index.html#.VQb6gUjJzyE","libraryItems":[],"transitions":[{"transitionId":6719,"projectId":93865,"partner":"Other","transitionDate":"2018-09-01","infusion":"Other","path":"Closed Out","details":"In FY18, JPL's physics-based models have been improved to reproduce the breathing mode oscillations commonly observed in Hall thrusters and have demonstrated that the dominant oscillations at Isp>2500 s are a different global mode never before characterized.
